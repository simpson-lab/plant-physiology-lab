Supporting information for the University of Regina course *BIOL 266 Plant Physiology* at home lab.

The rendered Rmarkdown files are viewable [here](https://simpson-lab.github.io/plant-physiology-lab/).

Data files referenced in the `.Rmd` file are in the `./data` folder. *Note*: we ask students to upload the required data file to RStudio.cloud and as a result the RMarkdown document shows the students how to load the data from the base directory, but during rendering the data are loaded from `./data`.

The `./images` folder contains the screenshots displayed in the lab document.

The `./<lab-name>/index_files` folders contain HTML resources needed to display the rendered lab documents accessible [here](https://simpson-lab.github.io/plant-physiology-lab/).
