The rendered Rmarkdown file is viewable [here](https://simpson-lab.github.io/plant-physiology-lab/).

Data files referenced in the `.Rmd` file are in the `/data` folder. *Note*: we ask students to upload the required data file to RStudio.cloud and as a result the RMarkdown document shows the students how to load the data from the base directory, but during rendering the data are loaded from `/data`.

The `/images` folder contains the screenshots displayed in the lab document.

`/index_files` contains the html resources needed to display the rendered lab document.
